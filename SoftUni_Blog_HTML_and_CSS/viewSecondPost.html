                        <h2>DevOps – a cultural shift</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>Success today is defined by the ability to turn ideas into value faster than your
                        competition, how quickly you can experiment, fail fast, learn fast, test, tune and make it
                        better. The behavior of developers is to make changes and enhance the application to generate
                        revenue streams. Operations, on the other hand, is all about stability and reliability to keep
                        business running 24/7. So how can you reconcile these two conflicting views and reduce friction
                        between the teams? Enter DevOps.

                        DevOps is not a technology but it is a process and a mindset change to promote collaboration
                        between Dev and Ops teams. According to research from Puppet Labs, IT organizations embracing DevOps
                        deploy 200x more frequently, have 24x faster recovery times, 3x lower failure rates and spend 22% less
                        time on unplanned work and rework. This is not a coincidence because these organizations have implemented
                        a process of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI and CD) where every step of the
                        application lifecycle from development to deployment is automated with feedback loops for continuous
                        improvement.
                        Infrastructure automation

                        Today, developers expect same level of efficiency, ease of access and disposal of infrastructure similar to
                        hyperscale cloud environments. Therefore, every part of the infrastructure should be composable and
                        accessible as a line of code. With HPE OneView, you can automate entire “Infrastructure-as-code” using
                        your favorite configuration management tools such as Chef, Puppet or Ansible and deploy IT resources for
                        any workload easily within few minutes, a task that used to take several days to weeks to deploy. A great example
                        of Composable Infrastructure is HPE Synergy which includes HPE 3PAR StoreServ flash storage and software-defined
                        storage StoreVirtual VSA as storage building blocks. The RESTful APIs from Storage platform are then exposed to
                        automation
                        tools via HPE OneView for storage provisioning, management etc.
                        All-Flash Array as a DevOps enabler

                        Historically, one of the reasons that Dev and Ops environments were siloed was because the underlying infrastructure
                        – and storage in particular – did not have the horsepower to host both of these environments on same platform.
                        This led to Dev and QA teams making their own redundant copies of datasets. Imagine if you had a 10TB database that
                        gets copied around. . . you get the picture. Using 3PAR All-flash array, Dev and Ops can be consolidated on the same
                        storage platform. Benefits to this approach include:

                        Storage footprint reduction. By creating snapshots/clones of production datasets, IT teams can eliminate the need
                        for Dev & QA to make multiple distinct copies of datasets.
                        Improve code quality and faster issue resolution. Application development/QA will have access to fresh production
                        quality datasets to test against real world environments.
                        On a 3PAR StoreServ All-Flash array, you can use features such as Priority Optimization to set Quality of Service
                        (QoS) controls and sub-1 ms latency. Ops teams can eliminate noisy neighbor issues and set bandwidth/IOPS/latency
                        goals for Dev teams without compromising production SLAs.

                        While DevOps is a power enabler that promotes collaboration between typically siloed Dev and Ops teams, it is equally
                        important to have the right infrastructure that provides necessary automation to keep pace with application innovation
                        and IT service delivery. HPE will be there as your partner as you take the journey towards a better enterprise that will
                        quickly turn Ideas into successful business models.

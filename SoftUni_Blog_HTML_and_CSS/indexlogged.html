                        <h2>Why Choosing the Right Storage Infrastructure.</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p> To be successful in today's disruptive business environment is not easy.
                        But by deploying a DevOps model with the right IT infrastructure,
                        your ideas can quickly become reality and put you ahead of the competition.
                        Here's how HPE 3PAR StoreServ flash storage can make that happen.
                        In our technology-driven world, it takes more than good ideas to be successful.
                        Uber, for example, didn’t need to invent a new technology to build its business.
                        The company just took advantage of the explosion of smartphones and mobile
                        applications to design a compelling customer experience and invent a new way of
                        doing business. But this isn’t just about Uber being able to execute a good idea.
                        It’s also about theinability of the cab industry to act quickly to transform its
                        town business models to compete. Did they have time to respond to the market disruption
                        that Uber represents? Absolutely. But they needed an IT infrastructure that would allow
                        them to pivot when the inevitable disruption arrived and they didn’t have that.

                    </header>

                    <p> Today, developers expect same level of efficiency, ease of access and disposal of infrastructure
                        similar to hyperscale cloud environments. Therefore, every part of the infrastructure should be
                        composable and accessible as a line of code. With HPE OneView, you can automate entire
                        “Infrastructure-as-code” using your favorite configuration management tools such as Chef,
                        Puppet or Ansible and deploy IT resources for any workload easily within few minutes, a task that
                        used to take several days to weeks to deploy. A great example of Composable Infrastructure is HPE
                        Synergy which includes HPE 3PAR StoreServ flash storage and software-defined storage StoreVirtual
                        VSA as storage building blocks. The RESTful APIs from Storage platform are then exposed to automation
                        tools via HPE OneView for storage provisioning, management etc.
